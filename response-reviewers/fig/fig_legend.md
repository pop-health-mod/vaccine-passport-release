__Figure R1. Weekly vaccination rates (among persons aged ≥12 years) and reported COVID-19 cases (among all individuals) in Québec (left column) and Ontario (right column).__ Note that the y-axis changes between each row of panels. The number of first doses administered and reported COVID-19 each week is shown (A) from March 2020 to July 2022, (B) from June to November 2021, and (C) from December 2021 to April 2022. The dashed lines in (C) show the dates when the respective provincial government announced the removal of vaccine passport policies (first line) and when these policies were lifted (second line).

__Figure R5. Effect estimates of the impact of vaccine passports on vaccination coverage from the sensitivity analyses for Québec (A, C, E) and Ontario (B, D, F).__ Each plot presents results from a different sensitivity analysis, organized by row: changing the start of the timeseries by ±1 week (A–B), changing the assumed length of the impact period by ±1 week (C–D), and changing the model specification for the relationship between the log-vaccination rate and time (E–F). Model fit is shown in Supplementary Figures S6–S10.
